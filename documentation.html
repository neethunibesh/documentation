        It continuously improved itself in terms of speed, accuracy, size, 
        and price to urge the form of the fashionable day computer.<br>

                </h2>
                <p>The technology behind the primary generation computers was a fragile glass device, which was called vacuum tubes. 
                    These computers were very heavy and really large in size. 
                    These weren’t very reliable and programming on them was a
                     really tedious 
                    task as they used high-level programming language and used no OS
                     First-generation computers were used for calculation, storage, 
                     and control purpose.</p>                     They were too bulky and large that they needed a full room and consume rot of electricity.</p>

                              It had been very heavy, large, and contained 18,000 vacuum tubes.</li>
                              <li><h3>EDVAC:</h3>Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer was designed by von Neumann.

                     <h2 id="g2">Second generation of computers:Transistors (1956-1963) </h2><p>Second-generation computers used the technology of 
                        transistors rather than bulky vacuum tubes. Another feature was the core storage.
                         A transistor may be a device composed of semiconductor material that amplifies a sign or opens or closes
                          a circuit.</p><p>

                        Transistors were invented in Bell Labs.
                         The use of transistors made it possible to perform powerfully and with due speed.
                          It reduced the dimensions and price and thankfully the warmth too, which was 
                          generated by vacuum tubes.
                                 Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, programming language and input, 
                                 and output units also came into the force within the second  generation.</p>
                                 <p>Programming language was shifted from high level to programming language 
                                    and made programming comparatively a simple task for programmers.
                                     Languages used for programming during this era were FORTRAN (1956), 
                                     ALGOL (1958), and COBOL (1959).

                                         a shift from huge transistors to integrated circuits, also referred to as IC. Here a variety of transistors were placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors. The most feature of this era’s computer was the speed and reliability. IC was made from silicon and also called silicon chips.
                                         A single IC, has many transistors, registers, and capacitors 
                                         built on one thin slice of silicon. The value size was reduced and 
                                         memory space and dealing efficiency were increased during this generation. 
                                         Programing was now wiped out Higher level languages like
                                          BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code).
                                           Minicomputers find their shape during this era.  <br>

<h2 id="g4">Fourth Generation Computers: Micro-processors (1971-Present)</h2>
<p>In 1971 First microprocessors were used,
   the large scale of integration LSI circuits built on one chip called microprocessors. The most advantage of this technology is that one microprocessor can contain all the circuits required to perform arithmetic, logic, and control functions on one chip.
<br><br>
  The computers using microchips were called microcomputers.
   This generation provided the even smaller size of computers, with larger capacities.
    That’s not enough, then Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits replaced LSI circuits. The Intel 4004chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the pc from the central processing unit and memory to input/ output controls
     on one chip and allowed the dimensions to reduce drastically.<br><br>
  
  Technologies like multiprocessing, multiprogramming, time-sharing, operating
  speed, and virtual memory made it a more user-friendly and customary
   device. The concept of private computers and computer networks came
    into being within the fourth generation</p>

 <h2  id="g5">Fifth Generation Computers</h2>
 <p>The technology behind the fifth generation of computers is AI.
   It allows computers to behave like humans.
    It is often seen in programs like voice recognition,
     area of medicines, and entertainment. Within the field of games 
     playing also it’s shown remarkable performance where computers 
     are capable of beating human competitors.<br><br>
     The speed is highest, size is that the smallest and area
      of use has remarkably increased within the fifth generation 
      computers.
      Though not a hundred percent AI has been achieved to
       date but keeping in sight the present developments, 
       it is often said that this dream also will become a reality
